My favourite movie is <b>Stand By Me</b>.
Stand by Me is a 1986 American coming-of-age 
comedy-drama film directed by Rob Reiner and 
starring Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, 
and Jerry O'Connell. 
The film, whose plot is based on Stephen King's book....
The Body (1982) and title is derived from Ben E. King's 
eponymous song, which plays over the ending credits, 
tells the story of four boys in a small town in 
Oregon who go on a hike to find the dead body of a missing child.
