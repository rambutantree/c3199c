<p>Republic Polytechnic (Abbreviation: RP) is a tertiary institution located in Singapore. Founded in 2002, it was the first school system in Singapore to use Problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy for all its diploma programmes.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
As an industry-oriented alternative to a broader based high school or post-secondary education, polytechnic graduates in Singapore are taught relevant and specific skills for the workplace. Valued as practice-oriented and knowledgeable professionals, polytechnic graduates are much sought after by the industry upon graduation although many continue to further their education and attain university degrees.
